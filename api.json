      "full": "The Simurgh (also spelled Simorgh, Simorg, or Simurgh) is one of the most magnificent and benevolent creatures in Persian mythology, depicted as an enormous mythical bird with the wisdom of ages and the power to heal. Originating from ancient Zoroastrian cosmology and immortalized in Ferdowsi's epic Shahnameh, the Simurgh embodies divine wisdom, healing powers, and the connection between heaven and earth. This legendary bird, said to have lived through three destructions and renewals of the world, nests atop the sacred Alborz Mountains and serves as a powerful symbol of purity, knowledge, and benevolent intervention in Persian and Iranian cultural heritage. The Simurgh represents the highest ideals of wisdom, compassion, and spiritual enlightenment in Iranian tradition."
